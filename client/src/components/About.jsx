        <h5>Audree Steinberg, software engineer</h5>
        <p className="fadeIn">After graduating from UC Berkeley with a B.A. in Political Science and minor in English, I moved to Japan. While learning Japanese and adventuring the countryside, I taught English in local public schools. I then moved to Tokyo to work at a finance & administration firm. During the covid-19 pandemic, I took Harvard's Intro to Computer Science online and was hooked. I graduated from Hack Reactor in 2021. When I'm not coding, you can find me out for a run or lounging in a local coffee shop. </p>
